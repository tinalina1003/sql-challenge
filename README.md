# Module 9 SQL Challenge

This is my bootcamp Module 9 Assignment, SQL Challenge
Data contains the preliminary csv files that contains all the data

EmployeeSQL contains the queries I have written. Note that EmployeeQueries.sql contains the queries for the challenge questions whereas EmployeeSchema.sql contains the export of the QuickDBD schema table code to create tables.
Note that QuickDBD does not allow for composite keys therefore I had to modify some parts of the QuickDBD exported file to have composite keys.

# INSTRUCTIONS

Data Engineering

    Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

    Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

    For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite key 

    Links to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

    Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
