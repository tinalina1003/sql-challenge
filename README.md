# sql-challenge
This is my bootcamp Module 9 Assignment, SQL Challenge
Data contains the preliminary csv files that contains all the data

EmployeeSQL contains the queries I have written. Note that EmployeeQueries.sql contains the queries for the challenge questions whereas EmployeeSchema.sql contains the export of the QuickDBD schema table code to create tables.
Note that QuickDBD does not allow for composite keys therefore I had to modify some parts of the QuickDBD exported file to have composite keys.
